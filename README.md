Small Matlab class to study efect of dispersion in the Propagation of a signal over a Transmission System

I use it in the lessons I teach in the University of CÃ³rdoba about Propagation of Electromagnetic Waves, to show the effect of dispersion in the signal, that is, when the attenuation is not constant with frecuency ant the wave number is not proportional to the frecuency.
